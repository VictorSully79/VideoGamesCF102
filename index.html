                Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages 
                of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission:
                 to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life
                  and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has
                   gone before. Many say exploration is part of our 
                   destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future
                    generations and their quest to ensure the
                     survival of the human species.
