                Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages 
                of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission:
                to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life
                and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has
                gone before. Many say exploration is part of our 
                destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future
                generations and their quest to ensure the
                survival of the human species.
